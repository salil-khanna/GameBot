# GameBot
My First Discord Bot

GameBot is an application that was programmed through Python, using the Discord library. The mindset behind designing this application was finding a fun way to entertain users in servers, such as me and my friends, all while getting some programming experience along the way. GameBot was one of my first application designed after switching majors to Computer Science, so I used this programming time to learn more about the process of generating, developing, and releasing a software applicaton idea. Some of the games I've coded within GameBot include~ Guess my Number, Memorize the Number, Memorize the Word, and my personal favorite, Verbal Memory Game!
